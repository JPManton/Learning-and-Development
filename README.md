# Learning-and-Development

Learning and development is a real passion of mine, both developing myself and coaching others around me.

I also actively look for new skills, hard and soft, to expand my knowledge base on course sites such as Udemy and DataCamp.  I have included a breakdown of these learnings in this repositoryâ€¦
